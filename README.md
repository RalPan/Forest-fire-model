# Forest-fire-model
In the third year of university I completed a project on the  the Drossel-Schwabl forest fire model, as part of the module "Scientific Computing Laboratory 2". This repository contains the final report, in the form of a Jupyter notebook and a pdf file detailing the aims of the project. 

I greatly enjoyed the exploratory aspect of this assignment and achieved 54 out of 60 points, or 90%.
